##Hellohooman

#What
Hellohooman // (used to be hellohuman) is a web app that implements webRTC technology to communicate.
It is basically an ome-tv clone.

#Why
Hellohooman was created for educational purposes.

#TODO
1. Shuffling logic, instead of stop-start-stop-start mechanism
2. (backend) use maps instead of array so it doesn't have to iterate over an array to find user information.
